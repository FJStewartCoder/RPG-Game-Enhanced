# Developer Road Map
## Introduction
It is just the normal roadmap but with a clearer direction for a developer. It will be more technically detailed and may include sub-steps to each goal.

## Road Map
### Better Tables (CURRENT)
Better table combination (only deep combine dictionary-like tables instead of list type tables)
+update docs for api

### Testing
Add testing to the entire program
Test loading table from file where data type is not implemented

### Campaign Improvements
Add gameloop to the campaign. So, it does not need to be run externally.
Add a setting in INIT to allow for specification of the start node.

## Future Considerations
