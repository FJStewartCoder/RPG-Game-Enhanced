## Introduction
It is just the normal roadmap but with a clearer direction for a developer. It will be more technically detailed and may include sub-steps to each goal.

## Road Map
### Stuck System
TODO or
main.cpp @ 284

### Better API
Give scripts access to copy, merge and show table functions.
+DOCS

## Considerations
### Unique Data Merge Strategy
Consider changing the merge strategy for the unique data and template
build.cpp @ line ~220

### Parse Coordinate Table Validation
Add validation for entering numbers too big or too small when parsing coordinates.
