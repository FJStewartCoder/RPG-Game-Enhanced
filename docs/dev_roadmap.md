# Developer Road Map
## Introduction
It is just the normal roadmap but with a clearer direction for a developer. It will be more technically detailed and may include sub-steps to each goal.

## Road Map
### Better API (CURRENT)
Give scripts access to merge table functions.
+DOCS ( merge )

### Stuck System
TODO or
main.cpp @ 284

If the user is unable to move, inform the user.
If they choose to unstuck, move the player back to the start. ( let them know this may not be the intentions of the campaign )
If they choose to continue, run the leaving function and re-land on the same node.
If they choose to quit, quit.
Repeat

## Future Considerations
