# Developer Road Map
## Introduction
It is just the normal roadmap but with a clearer direction for a developer. It will be more technically detailed and may include sub-steps to each goal.

## Road Map
### Better Tables (CURRENT, TESTED)
Better table combination (only deep combine dictionary-like tables instead of list type tables)
+update docs for api

Update uses of combine table to now be appropriate for this.
build.cpp @ 216 - 226
campaign.cpp @ 716 - 720
+ updates does for where these are combined
+ relevant to unique data combined into the template (NOW DEEP COMBINES TABLES BECAUSE LISTS NOW WORK AS INTENDED)
+ relevant to how data is reloaded

### Testing
Add testing to the entire program
Test loading table from file where data type is not implemented

### Campaign Improvements
Add gameloop to the campaign. So, it does not need to be run externally.
Add a setting in INIT to allow for specification of the start node.
