# Developer Road Map
## Introduction
It is just the normal roadmap but with a clearer direction for a developer. It will be more technically detailed and may include sub-steps to each goal.

## Road Map
### Better Save (CURRENT)
campaign.cpp @ line 717
Apply use of new functions where used.

Save every N gameloops

### Campaign Improvements
Add gameloop to the campaign. So, it does not need to be run externally.
Add a setting in INIT to allow for specification of the start node.

### Testing
Add testing to the entire program
Test loading table from file where data type is not implemented

## Future Considerations
None
