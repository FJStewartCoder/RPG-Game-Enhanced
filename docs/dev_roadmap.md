# Developer Road Map
## Introduction
It is just the normal roadmap but with a clearer direction for a developer. It will be more technically detailed and may include sub-steps to each goal.

## Road Map
### Better Save (CURRENT)
Save a sol::object rather than per type.
Allows vars to be any type but prefixed with 'v'
Ensure old functions are kept for backwards compatibility

Apply use of new functions where used.

NEED TO NOW BE ABLE TO READ
NEED TO TEST

### Campaign Improvements
Add gameloop to the campaign. So, it does not need to be run externally.
Add a setting in INIT to allow for specification of the start node.

### Testing
Add testing to the entire program
Test loading table from file where data type is not implemented

## Future Considerations
