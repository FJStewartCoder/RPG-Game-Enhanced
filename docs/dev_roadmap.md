## Introduction
It is just the normal roadmap but with a clearer direction for a developer. It will be more technically detailed and may include sub-steps to each goal.

## Road Map
### Reworked Nodes (CURRENT)
Re-write making_a_campaign.md
FIX DOCUMENTATION

TEST THE LIST PARAMETER SYSTEM i.e test if you put less args in, too many args in and verify the order.
USE ALL OF THE EXAMPLES AS TESTS

ADD THIS TO campaigns/test_campaign

### Gameloop From Save
Need to load the position first before making any actions when loading from save file. Also don't run the landing function

### Documentation

Add documentation to the entire program including better headers.
