# Developer Road Map
## Introduction
It is just the normal roadmap but with a clearer direction for a developer. It will be more technically detailed and may include sub-steps to each goal.

## Road Map
### Better API ( v1.0.2 )
Give the user access to a function to see if a node exists at given coordinates and get its unique data.
Add documentation for this.
Update change log with these changes.

### Stuck System ( v1.0.3 )
Find TODO in main.cpp or check @ line 284.

If the user is unable to move, inform the user.
If they choose to unstuck, move the player back to the start. ( let them know this may not be the intentions of the campaign )
If they choose to continue, run the leaving function and re-land on the same node.
If they choose to quit, quit.
Repeat
