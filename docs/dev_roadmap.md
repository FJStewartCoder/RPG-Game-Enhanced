# Developer Road Map
## Introduction
It is just the normal roadmap but with a clearer direction for a developer. It will be more technically detailed and may include sub-steps to each goal.

## Road Map
### Better Tables (CURRENT, UNTESTED)
Function to compare two tables. If they are the same, return true, else false.
ADD LOGGING TO THIS FUNCTION

Better table combination (only deep combine dictionary-like tables instead of list type tables)
+update docs for api

Better table loading (if the data type is unknown, cancel loading and return an error)

### Testing (CURRENT)
HAVE A SETTING THAT OPTIONALLY DISABLES LOGGING DURING TESTING
Add testing to the entire program
This can be optionally run if developer

### Campaign Improvements
Add gameloop to the campaign. So, it does not need to be run externally.
Add a setting in INIT to allow for specification of the start node.

## Future Considerations
